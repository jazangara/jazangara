## Greetings, I'm Justine ✨

#About me:
I'm a Computer Science Undergraduate student with a concentration in Data Science at Fairleigh Dickinson University.
Recently, I've been riding the AI/ML pipeline, I'm always looking ahead to the future!
In between classes, I work as a TA for the "FDU CS for All" program, teaching teachers to implement CS in their classrooms.
